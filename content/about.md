Hi! I'm Henry. I am an Electronics Engineer with a passion of making things - any things. I will give anything a go and love to have a problem to solve. 

I have over 10 years of professional experience within Electronics engineering and love to apply my knowledge at home. I am a keen on working / developing with / on PCBs, Linux, Microcontrollers, FPGAs, Radios, Web - and across the hardware and software disciplines. 

This blog is an attempt to document all of my goings on, from cooking to crochet and from lego to lathes. There will be a lot of back filling of projects that I have done in the past that I feel are of note. 

Subjects include, but not limited to: 
 - Electronics (personal hobbies, this is!)
 - Machining (lathes, mills)
 - Woodworking
 - Cooking
 - Crochet
 - DIY
 - Engines, cars and motorbikes
 - General musings and rants
 - Anything else that can be taken apart, tinkered with, modified or stuff I find interesting!


This blog is very much a minimum viable project. I will eventually get a mailing list going and a contact me button, but for now, this HTML will just be put on the ether that is the internet and I'll never know if anyone reads it. But that's not the point, right?
